eDex API Example (For Infor / AMSI / eSite)
This code is released to the public domain and is

To use, you'll need the savon and nokogiri gems installed,
and you'll need to get the appropriate YOUR_X_HERE variables
from your account representative and put them in edex.rb.

You can then run 'ruby edex.rb' from the command line (assuming
you have Ruby installed.)
